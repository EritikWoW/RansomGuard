# RansomGuard 0.7.3.0

RansomGuard is a Windows **anti-encryption and recovery layer**, not a general antivirus.
Its target is to preserve original data before destructive mutation, contain continued encryption,
and recover data through rollback plus adaptive crypto analysis.

## Core preservation milestone

0.7.3.0 retains the 0.7.2 range-aware COW gate and adds explicit CREATE preservation semantics.

Ordinary WRITE operations still use **range-aware copy-on-write**:

    WRITE arrives
        -> minifilter holds it
        -> user mode records original file length
        -> only original blocks intersecting that write are durably captured
        -> block + hash-chained journal are flushed
        -> SnapshotCommitted
        -> original WRITE may continue

Each original block is captured at most once per incident session. Later writes to the same block reuse
the already committed pre-image. Appends beyond the original EOF need only the baseline length and are
undone by truncating the recovered copy to that length.

Rename, delete-disposition and explicit truncate/allocation-length operations remain on the conservative
**full-file pre-image** path for now.

The engineering minifilter protocol is now v4 and reports CREATE, WRITE, RENAME, DELETE and TRUNCATE-class metadata operations.

For CREATE, the gate distinguishes Windows create dispositions instead of treating every open as destructive:
existing `FILE_SUPERSEDE`, `FILE_OVERWRITE` and `FILE_OVERWRITE_IF` require a durable full pre-image;
`FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE` also requires a pre-image for an existing file even with an ordinary open;
create-capable dispositions on a missing path durably record that the path was originally absent; ordinary
non-destructive opens require no snapshot. Existing-directory delete-on-close is denied until directory-topology rollback exists. Paths marked originally absent do not later manufacture rollback
pre-images from data created during the same incident.

## Recovery safety

Range recovery:

- never overwrites the damaged source;
- reconstructs into a new `.ransomguard-cow-recovered` file;
- verifies every captured block by SHA-256 before applying it;
- restores the original file length;
- refuses reconstruction when the damaged source is shorter than the recorded baseline, because that
  requires the full-preimage/transaction recovery path.

The existing full pre-image recovery remains available for rename/delete/truncate scenarios and also
writes only to a new recovery copy.

## LAB safety boundaries

The blocking gate is still deliberately restricted:

- one explicit disposable directory only;
- requires `.ransomguard-gate-lab-root`;
- refuses an entire drive, Windows, Program Files, ProgramData and reparse roots;
- rollback storage must be outside the gated root;
- out-of-root or name-query-failed I/O fails open;
- a path truncated after an already verified in-root prefix is denied rather than preserved against an ambiguous name;
- in-scope preservation failure or timeout fails closed;
- negative/special write offsets are denied rather than guessed;
- demand-start filter, automatic attachment suppressed;
- altitude `370099.4242` is an unassigned LAB placeholder and must never ship;
- no kernel file-writing, deletion, process-kill or process-suspend APIs are used.

Do **not** load this blocking prototype on a primary workstation or point it at real user data.

## Current boundary

This milestone validates the preservation model and reduces write-path storage amplification.
It is not yet production ransomware blocking.

Remaining core work includes post-create identity reconciliation, rename-destination identity tracking,
bounded concurrent gate workers, crash reconciliation, durable per-volume/file identity, memory-mapped write coverage,
containment policy, process-state capture, adaptive crypto reconstruction, verified recovery orchestration,
driver signing and Microsoft-assigned production altitude.
